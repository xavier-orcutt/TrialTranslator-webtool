# TrialTranslator-webtool

## Introduction
The webtool, inspired by the TrialTranslator framework, provides survival estimates for novel cancer therapies based on a patient's machine learning-derived mortality risk and biomarker status. The webtool can be accessed at: [trialtranslator.com.](https://www.trialtranslator.com)

For details on the building of the machine learning models and survival analysis, please refer to the following respository: [TrialTranslator-notebooks.](https://github.com/xavier-orcutt/TrialTransaltor-notebooks)

Disclaimer: The research was conducted by the University of Pennsylvania. The website has not undergone evaluation by the FDA as a clinical decision support tool. In addition, it has not been retrained for recent developments in the standard of care. Please be aware the model and its performance are not regularly monitored in accordance with any performance metric.
