## Introduction
*Boosted Forecaster* is a web tool that risk stratifies patients with newly diagnosed metastatic cancer using a gradient-boosted survival model. It also provides survival estimates for novel therapies and compares it to randomized clinical trial results. 
 
 See [here](https://github.com/xavier-orcutt/rct_generalizability_flatiron) for more information on model build and survival estimates.
